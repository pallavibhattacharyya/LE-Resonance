# LE-Resonance
This repository contains an SVR-based ML algorithm to extract acceptor (A) yields at 1 picosecond for a D1-D2-A ratcheted system, characterized by the energy gap and electronic coupling between D1 and D2 and the frequency and the Huang-Rhys factor of the intramolecular vibrational mode being used as a ratchet. If the user has approximate values obtained from spectra and/or calculations about the energies of the monomer and the dimer D1-D2, the user will be able to use the ML algorithm to obtain a set of values for the frequencies of the intramolecular mode that are able to perform efficient ratcheting. A suitable HR factor will further help narrow down the choice.
