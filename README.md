This repository contains an SVR-based ML algorithm to extract acceptor (A) yields at 1 picosecond for a D1-D2-A ratcheted system, characterized by the energy gap and electronic coupling between D1 and D2 and the frequency and the Huang-Rhys factor of the intramolecular vibrational mode being used as a ratchet.
